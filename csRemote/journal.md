hello i love my journal so much



1/23/2026
This is my first testing entry and in class we have
learned how to connect to the same repository


However we haven't learned how to branch from it yet
This also is saying we havent practiced using git 
collectively in a team yet but we understand that it's
possible

seems we need one entry per week and the teacher is telling
us we need it. lol


2/10/26
learned more in class about branches and how to use them effectively
so that we don't ruin main for other people until we are done
with our part then we can merge it back into main when reviewed by
other team members
